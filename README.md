Spring Point Solutions, plans to work on, providing effective job prices to the motor repair shop vendors. 

I am learning to explore more in the field of Business Analyst. One of the ways to write a software requirements is through User Stories. As the name suggests, User Stories, are the stories drafted from a particular user's perspective. The User Stories help the developement team to priortize and implement tasks effectively. Acceptance Criteria provides a checklist to the development team. The preciseness of the checklist helps the development team to validate if the requirements are met, whcih in turn validates if the user story is met.

I am looking forward to improve my communication skills, planning and prioritzing skills, as well as improve my technical skills! It's a whole package!
